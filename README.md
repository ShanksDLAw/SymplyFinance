# SymplyFinance
Symply Finance is an AI-driven platform providing clear answers to your finance and investment queries. Get started with your OpenAI and Google SERPER API keys and run it using Streamlit.

Getting Started
To use Symply Finance, you'll need API keys for OpenAI and Google SERPER.

Prerequisites
OpenAI API key: You can obtain this from the OpenAI website. Please follow the instructions for creating an API key in the OpenAI documentation.
Google SERPER API key: You can create this by visiting serper.dev.
Running the Code
Once you have the necessary API keys, you can run the code using Streamlit. If you haven't installed Streamlit, you can do so with pip install streamlit. Then, run the command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run FinancialAdvisory.py
This will launch the Symply Finance application in your web browser.

Please note that the development of Symply Finance faced challenges with the utilization of web search APIs. Our future plans include migrating to Azure to utilize its compatibility with OpenAI and harmonize the search APIs. We also plan to integrate financial APIs for enhanced services.

We hope Symply Finance will become your go-to platform for financial advice and look forward to hearing your feedback as we continue to develop and improve our services.
